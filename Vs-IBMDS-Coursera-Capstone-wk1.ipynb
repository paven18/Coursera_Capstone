Introduction/Business Problem-</b> A description of the problem and a discussion of the background.\n\nAn entrepreneur wants to open a restaurant in the Downtown Toronto area. There are several Neighborhoods in the Downtown Toronto area. The ideal location will be the one that already has different types of restaurants and also satisfies other business criteria such as the target customers, type of the restaurant and finances available. The objective is to come up with the top 10 types of Venues in each neighborhood. This analysis will help any entrepreneur to determine the ideal location depending on the target customers, type of the restaurant and finances available for the business that is proposed to be opened.\n\n\n\n"
